## Featured Projects

### **ThermoML Parser**  
Parsed 1,200+ ThermoML XML files to extract structured thermophysical property data (e.g., thermal conductivity) for machine learning workflows. Includes robust CLI, uncertainty handling, and FAIR-inspired data modeling.

- [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/yourusername/thermoml-parser)
- [PDF Summary](assets/pdfs/thermoml_summary.pdf)

### **Thermal Conductivity ML Model**  
Built a machine learning pipeline using Citrine + UCSB datasets. Applied matminer-based feature engineering, trained ensemble models (e.g., XGBoost, Random Forest), and interpreted results using SHAP.

**New Dev Branch**:  
Iâ€™m actively developing a side branch to explore:

- Deep learning with TensorFlow + PyTorch
- Dockerized training and deployment
- ML experiment modularization

- [Main Repo](https://github.com/acfdavis/Thermal-Conductivity-ML)
- [DL + Docker Branch](https://github.com/acfdavis/Thermal-Conductivity-ML/tree/feature/dl-tf-torch-docker)
